First of all, Thank you for stopping by. As you have already dedicated your time to know me better, please give 1 more minute to read the following.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Sajib Sen`, a *Software Engineer*, a *Researcher* and a *Computational Science Enthusiast*.  I love to dedicate my time to build great software products and help a business succeed with their goals. 

I was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and traveled to the United States for my master's program in Computer Science from [CS, UofM][cs-uofm] and graduated with Honors in April 2020.

I have over 2 years of professional experience in developing web platforms in the industry and research laboratory. I always strive to learn, progress and share new knowledge. I started programming from 2014, since then I have come that far and advanced a lot. I am constantly hungry and feel excited to work on interesting projects.


#### I believe in the statement -
> Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better.

- D. Knuth (Computer Programming as an Art. Turing Award Speech 1974) 


# What is this site about?
Sharing and discussing newly learned concepts, mostly about technology. I will use this site to share my clarity about relatively esoteric concepts and exciting programming problems. The primary goal is helping someone who needs it and helping myself from positive criticism.
