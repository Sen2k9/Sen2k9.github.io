              (19-21) at Studio/Stage in Hollywood, 8pm. I'll be at the opening tonight with signed vinyl records (which

          <p>In lieu of a physical album release, I worked with Vermont-based artist Kylie Dally of Potions Press to create limited edition art to accompany the album. Kylie created a set of six illustrations, one for each track on the album. Each illustration was hand carved on a woodblock and printed with oil-based black ink on wildcrafted, handmade lokta paper. The beautiful prints are 5” squares and look great framed individually or as a set. We present to you a limited edition run of 25, available on my bandcamp page. A digital copy of the album accompanies your purchase.

            In October of last year, I trekked out to the Olympic Peninsula with film maker Anne Cleary and my sister Lesley Allison to make a music video for the title track of the album. We shot it over two very cold Pacific Northwest days and were extremely fortunate that the rain held off long enough to capture the dramatically lit landscape. Enjoy!

        <h2>Pre-order for Portal out on Bandcamp Friday</h2>
      </div>



      <div class="para1">
        <p>May has always been an exciting month for me. As Spring comes into its fullest expression we are given hints of the Summer to come. Encouraged by the long hours of sunshine, life is finding routine and moving faster and faster, the dormant months of winter becoming a distant memory. It is into this season I was born.  Perhaps this is why I feel a bit more wind at my back during this time. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="para2">
        <p>
          The pandemic has put a temporary hold on performing and has offered me an opportunity to spend lots of time creating music in the studio. This time has been a gift.  As live performance begins to open up, I am searching for ways to preserve the routines I have created in the studio while also finding joy in performing again. 
        </p>

      <div class="para3">
        <p>
          In June of 2020 I moved from my congested East Hollywood apartment to the open rolling hills of Sonoma County. Surrounded by vineyards and large oak groves, I created an album of music that had been bubbling just under the surface, waiting for the right conditions to burst through the cracks. And burst through it did! I spent six weeks recording in my friend Mitchel Slade’s studio, layering melodies and sounds of the violin and viola over and around each other, creating textures and sounds that had been growing and evolving within the confines my mind’s ear. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para4">
      <p>
        Today, it is with great pleasure that I present to you Portal: 
      </p>

    <div class="image1">
      <img style="width: 690px; height: 190px;" src="down img/google.png" alt="">

      <div class="para5">
        <p>
          Portal is a sonic exploration of the seven centers of awakening. With violin- and viola-based compositions that move from intimate melodies to wide orchestral soundscapes, each track on the album represents an energy center in the body, a Chakra in Yogic philosophy, in which is held certain energies that we're either aware of or are in the dark about. The music represents the transmutation of those energies from the lower forms of the material plane, through the portal of the heart, and into the astral realm. The creation of this album was a journey of self discovery and opening up to the world around me. It represents a spiritual awakening that I experienced in the year leading up to recording it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="para6">
        <p>
          Portal is available to pre-order through my Bandcamp page. Today is Bandcamp Friday, which means that all fees and revenue shares on purchases from the site today are waived. 100% of what you pay goes to the artist (thanks Bandcamp!). With the purchase today, you get the first piece, Arise, and when the album is released on June 11, you will be notified and will be able to download the whole digital album. 
        </p>

      <div class="para7">
        <p>
          The album is being released by my newly founded record label Holy Volcano. The label has new music from Tristan de Liège and RAQIA coming this summer and I am thrilled to be orchestrating those releases. If you are interested in stickers of the logo drawn by Ramin Nazer, click on the logo below! They are available in four color schemes.

        <p>Morning in the desert. Winter Solstice. Moon is waxing gibbous. Saturn and Jupiter in nearest conjunction in some 400 years. Looking for quiet, peace, rest, and it is close. The desert night is cold. Very cold. The fire was a welcome warmth and my layers of blankets were necessary for the freezing that the night brought on. And now the day brings a warmth from the sun and a still-lingering crispness in the air, which is unquestionably dry. Very dry. And the sun's warmth exaggerates that and that is ok as long as I am hydrating and protecting myself with the water and oils I've brought. This land is hardly habitable by men. We must bring supplies from elsewhere just to last a couple of nights. Beyond that we are helpless here. But somehow not all life is helpless in this desert. The birds song this morning was lovely and brought much joy as I listened from my cocoon.
          </p>

      <div class="para2">
        <p>
          As I sit and relax my body one piece by one piece, I begin to tap into the feeling of immense joy and complete ease and satisfaction, the feeling that I am just enough. There is an  awareness within me that this feeling is a joy that will last a lifetime, maybe infinite lifetimes, and I'm tapping into it. I can feel this feeling and am letting my imagination soar. I go to a time when this is the only feeling there is and it exists in all moments. It is The Experience. This thought brings more joy to this moment. I feel lighter and more at ease.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="para3">
        <p>
          And then I experience this feeling as a feeling in others and find that the simple wish for them to be happy brings even more joy and love to my heart. Just simply wishing them joy and happiness brings me a joy and happiness that is unparalleled and makes me feel more connected to them. So the task is simple: just wish someone happiness and it will be so. That is all. And then we all tap into the joyful, blissful, highness that is possible though this life. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="para4">
      <p>
        How much more clearly I can see now. And how much this frees me from the burdens of discontent.

        <p>These days go on and on into an endless oblivion. The sun, the ocean, the perfect unchanging Southern California weather. It's awful. It's painful. It is utterly boring.

          I seek some kind of pleasure in food, always looking for the next meal. Anticipating, craving, salivating. I can hardly make it though an hour without checking out the situation in the kitchen, even though I was just there and know the whole inventory. Maybe something new will be waiting for me! Maybe there will be a sweet surprise. Maybe I'll come to a beautiful conclusion about my next meal, a spark of inspiration will hit and this meal will be the meal to end all hunger. These are just some of the thoughts that come to mind as I traverse the harsh landscape that is the day. What do I do with myself? How can I keep from eating? I cannot. I work so hard restraining myself in so many ways but food has such a grip on me. "Study it," I tell myself. "Study the craving, acknowledge it, dive into it." I don't know. Maybe tomorrow. I think I should practice the Buddha's discourse on the repulsive nature of food. I've been doing all of this thanking and showing gratitude for the energy that the food brings me, but maybe it's time to go the other direction and become repulsed by it.

        <p>
          Nothing ever happens. Or, rather, it is always happening. And so nothing can happen while it is happening because it- whatever that is- would have to stop happening for it to happen and it never stops happening. So that's all there is. Sometimes it's enthralling. Sometimes boring. Sometimes agitating. There doesn't seem to be anything in particular to DO. Everything is taken care of. Am I completely crazy?! Am I just so far distanced from society that I actually believe there's nothing to do when everyone else seems to be running around and DOING all the time? I mean, what is this? What have I gotten into? Pleasure seeking, waiting for the future to come, satiating cravings: it's all a drag. The only redeeming feeling comes from knowing that so many others are doing it too. Or not doing it. That is the part that makes it worthwhile: everyone doing nothing together. What a trip.

          The desert wind rolls and moves and yet remains constant. The morning air is cold and the blues muted and mystical. As the sun emerges from behind the mountains the colors become bright and whitewashed. The sun heats up my skin and I strip my protective layers one by one: the hat, the scarf, the jacket, the sweater, and finally the shoes. To feel the earth on the bare skin is essential in really feeling the soul of a place. I went out to record the wind, but will have to make a trek out farther from the campsite if I really want to capture the fullness of tone and character. It's the tone of the movement across the flats and through the brittle and dried low brush. The mountains reverberate the sound and I can hear it move from one direction to another. As I move toward the sound, it disappears from the direction I am moving to and appears behind me. So I turn and move toward the sound in the other direction and again, it disappears and sounds as if it's from a new direction. What tricks the wind is playing on me! Or, is it my own limited perception that grasps onto a sound in one direction only, never able to truly perceive how the wind is, at all times, all around me?

        <h2>Field Recording at Fort Worden</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="pagepara12">
        <p>          
          I'm out in Port Townsend on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, recording in the old bunkers of Fort Worden State Park. The fort was built in the early 20th century and has been abandoned and converted into a state park and a playground for sonic explorers like myself. The dozens of underground bunkers each offer a unique sound experience rich in reverb and warm, rolling echoes.  With my mobile recording unit I'm capturing the sounds of metal, concrete, wood, and water, and also using my violin to show off the rich sonic architecture of the bunkers. My favorite is a U-Shaped bunker that that is approximately 100 yards from end to end. The way that sound rolls through the length of the U reminds me of the sound of thunder rolling across great canyons, expanding as it moves through space, propelled by the walls of the canyons. This place is special and endlessly inspiring.

          I'll be driving north next week to do some recording and a video shoot on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. The peninsula is <br> one of my favorite places in the world and October is a dynamic and inspiring month to be up there creating art. Last year I was on <br> a fall tour in the Pacific Northwest with my band RAQIA and we made a stop on the Peninsula where we created wild sounds in <br> the bunkers at Fort Warden State Park in Port Townsend, meditated in the deep silence of the Hoh Rainforest, and walked the bleak <br> and other-worldly beaches at the western-most point of the Continental United States. Upon returning home I wrote this travel <br> poem, inspired my the ever changing environments of tour life. I nostalgically share it now, with a feeling- a longing- to get back <br> out on the road and share the art, the music, the show. <br>

          I'm talking about my lovely piano, of course. It has been at my old apartment since I moved out in January and I've been missing it! I bought this piano five years ago at a shop in Portland that no longer exists called the Immortal Piano Company (if the name stands true then I do believe it to exist somewhere). Owner Martha Taylor is a wonderfully eccentric person and her knowledge of pianos, especially American pianos, is vast. Every time I walked into her shop I felt as if time stopped and nothing mattered but the tones and inner workings of these huge instruments. She was always excited to educated anyone who was willing to listen about the inner workings of a piano. She had pianos in various states of repair and would always bring me to her latest project, cursing at the number of joints that had to be aligned just perfectly for a single key to function.  She closed her shop around 2018, claiming to me that she was done fixing these ancient beasts and that she was offered a book deal to write about the history of pianos in America.

          The piano I bought from Martha is a Mueller & Haines console upright from around 1920. When I sat down to play it in the shop, I fell in love immediately and knew I couldn't leave the shop without it.  It was the dark varnish, the stately legs, and the brightness and clarity of tone that sold me. I played and taught on this piano in Portland for two years before moving to LA, and when I settled I had it shipped down to my apartment. It was a perfect fit in that South Pasadena apartment, but my stay did not last. I left it there until I could find a permanent spot for it and now, after seven months apart, we've reunited in my rehearsal space in downtown LA.

          An instrument is a tool and something with which a musician builds a personal relationship. This piano and I have composed together at all hours of the day and night, and I have touched those keys in all emotional states. The instrument never fails to aide me in finding what I'm ultimately seeking, which is a place of rest in the present and freedom from the mind that is so keen on keeping us in the past or planning for the future. I'm happy to have my baby back.

        <p>          
          Back in Los Angeles in early August the neighborhood birds are not as active as <br> when I left on the last day of May. Before I left, this is what I heard: <br>


          —— <br>
          
          —— <br>
          
          
          A sparrow hops along the edge of a rooftop <br>
          
          with the inertia of a pebble skipping over a glass lake. <br> 
          <br>
          <span></span>
          
          
          The wind meets a tree and it’s branches sway <br>
          
          greeting the wind with spinning leaves <br>
          
          and together, <br>
          
          wind and tree, <br>
          
          they sing. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          The sparrow listens and hops once more <br>
          
          this time off of the rooftop into the arms of the wind <br>
          
          and together, <br>
          
          sparrow and wind, <br>
          
          they sing. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          The sparrow lands on the swaying branch, <br>
          
          mid duet with the wind, <br>
          
          and the branch sways with the inertia from the sparrow  <br>
          
          and together, <br>
          
          in three part harmony, <br>
          
          tree, wind and sparrow, <br>
          
          they sing. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          I sit up and look around <br>
          
          curious if there are others in the audience. <br>
          
          I see a man pushing a stroller, <br>
          
          a woman delivering food, <br>
          
          a young couple <br>
          
          walking hand-in-hand. <br>
          
          It seems that no one else <br>
          
          caught the show. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          I feel the wind stop <br>
          
          and I look up at the branch. <br>
          
          The sparrow is gone. <br>
          
          And yet I hear singing still. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          I look back toward the street <br>
          
          and together <br>
          
          a man, a woman, and a young couple <br>
          
          sing. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          I smile, <br>
          
          sip the last of my coffee, <br>
          
          and walk inside my apartment, <br>
          
          singing. <br>
          <br>
          <br>

Or chips, leftovers, salted roasted peanuts, a banana with almond butter, a sandwich, pretty much anything that I can put in my mouth, chew, and digest. Every time I’m near my kitchen, even if I’m not hungry, the thought of eating comes into my mind and my senses become aroused. I have plenty of baggage tied to eating and unpacking it has taken a lot of work.  The most helpful thing I’ve come across on this path has been cultivating an awareness of the thoughts, sensations, feelings, emotions, actions, results, and consequences that revolve around eating. There is a lot to work with and everybody’s relationship to eating is wholly unique.  As someone who practices Vipassana (mindfulness) meditation, I thought I’d share three practices that have helped me understand eating much more fully. <br>

          The first practice is to cultivate gratitude for the food that is in front of you by thanking all the people that made it possible for the food to get to you.  This practice sheds light on how much energy is behind each bite of food and allows us access to all of that energy. I like to take one piece of food in the meal (say, a vegetable) and work backwards in time to thank all the people that brought it to where it is right now.  For example, if I’m eating a salad that has red lettuce in it, I will start by giving thanks to myself for preparing the lettuce, and then work back through the life of the lettuce, thanking everyone I can think of who had a hand in bringing it to where it is right now. Here is what it might sound like: “I am grateful to myself for chopping and dressing this lettuce with such care and intention to fuel my body.  I am grateful to myself for taking the time to drive back from the grocery store safely with the lettuce.  I give thanks to myself for choosing such a good head of lettuce from the grocery store.  Thank you to the grocery clerk who sold me the lettuce.  Thank you to the grocery worker who moved the lettuce from the back to the front of the store and stocked it on the shelf. Thank you to the person who unloaded the lettuce from the delivery truck and handled it with care. Thank you to the delivery driver who drove the lettuce from the distribution center to the grocery store. Thank you to all the people who handled the lettuce with care at the distribution center. Thank you to the person who delivered the lettuce from the farm to the distribution center. Thank you to the person on the farm who loaded the truck with the lettuce and handled it with care. Thank you to the farm worker who cut the lettuce and delivered it to the proper place so it could be picked up.  Thank you to the people who cared for the plant by watering it and making sure it was healthy and not infected and safe to eat.  Thank you to the owner of the farm and all who run it. Thank you to the person who planted the seed. Thank you to the person who delivered the seed to the farm. Thank you to the person who bought the seeds. Thank you to the person who owns the seed farm. Thank you to the worker of the seed farm who packaged the seed. Thank you to the worker of the seed farm who picked the seed. Thank you to the worker of the seed farm who watered the plant and cared for it to make sure the seed was good for growing and safe for consumption. Thank you to the people who oversee the sales of seeds to farms. Thank you to the people who make sure our food is grown responsibly and is safe to eat.” This can go on as long as you want and it can be fun to get creative with it. The longer you go, the more gratitude you’ll create for this little piece of lettuce and when you finally eat it, it may be the healthiest thing you’ve ever eaten. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          The second practice for mindful eating is to meditate on the elemental makeup of the food and see how it is similar to your own elemental makeup.  We can look at the earth, air, fire, and water elements of the food and compare them with those elements within us. Doing this practice leads to a dissolution of the separateness between “I” and “that which I eat” and unlocks the wisdom that both our being and the food are simply energy in motion. Let’s take a banana. Beginning with the earth element, I would look at the banana in terms of it's solidity and ask questions about it.  What is the shape of it? Is it curved? How is it curved, where is it curved? Where is the density of the banana? And then moving to questions of the earth element in me: What shape am I? Where are my curves? What parts of me are solid, dense, material? What is the weight of the banana? How does it feel in my hands? What is my own weight and how do I hold myself up? The questions don’t need to be answered in words or concepts.  Just let the questions hang and meditate on them.  Next is air: Where is there space in the banana? Are there holes in it? Where is the space in me? Where do I feel lightness and air moving through me? The fire element relates to temperature:  How warm is the banana? Is the temperature uniform or does it vary in different places on the banana? How warm am I? Am I uniform in my temperature? Where am I colder? Where am I warmer? What makes me feel warm or cold? Then moving onto water, the binder of material: How wet is the banana? Where is it wet? Where is it dry? Is it sticky? Where am I wet? Where am I dry? Where am I sticky? Where am I lacking water? All of these questions can be asked before a bite is taken from the banana. Once you begin eating, you can ask more questions as the elements of the banana and those of the self come together. What is the temperature of the banana in my throat? Is it making me warmer or colder? Is the banana changing temperature too? How wet does it feel in my mouth? Is it making me salivate more? Is the banana becoming wetter in my mouth? What is the shape of the banana in my mouth? What is the shape of the inside of my mouth? How is the shape changing with the banana in it? As you do this practice, notice how you are relating to your body and take note of any changes. <br>

          <br>
          
          
          The third practice of mindful eating is to cultivate detailed awareness of the actions of eating as experienced through the senses.  Our entire experience of the world around us can be broken down into our intake of phenomena through the five sense doors, and eating is an experience that stimulates all five of them. There aren’t many daily activities that so thoroughly activate our senses. No wonder we are so driven to the pleasures of food! In this practice, we name the actions that are happening as they are happening as we are eating the food. It is necessary to work slowly to find awareness of all processes that are happening.  Let’s say we have a bowl of warm food and we’re eating with a spoon. The bowl is in front of us and we are looking at the food. We see the shapes and colors so we say “looking, looking, looking” as this is the action that is happening.  We don’t need to specify what we’re seeing, just label the action (looking at the food) and repeat it as it’s happening. If we catch a smell coming from the bowl, we would say “smelling, smelling, smelling.” We might then feel our arm move toward the spoon and we say “moving, moving, moving” because we’re feeling our arm move.  As we grab the spoon, “holding, holding, holding.” Then as the spoon goes into the bowl, we hear the sound of it entering into the food and we say “hearing, hearing, hearing.” Our hand then feels the warmth of the food and we say “feeling, feeling, feeling.” As we bring the spoonful of food toward our mouth, we can say “moving, moving, moving.” And as it enters our mouth, “tasting, tasting, tasting.” We don’t need to label what it is we are tasting, or what we are moving.  It’s not about the objects at play (nouns) it’s about the actions (adjectives) as they relate to the senses.  You may begin chewing the food, “chewing, chewing, chewing” and you may notice the taste changing, “tasting, tasting, tasting” and the consistency shifting, “feeling, feeling, feeling” and as it moves to your throat, “swallowing, swallowing, swallowing” you may find yourself with another spoonful of food ready to go into your mouth before you’ve swallowed everything that was in the previous spoonful. Did you notice how the spoon got there? Were you “moving, moving, moving” your arm while you were “chewing, chewing, chewing?” Did you do any “smelling, smelling, smelling” as the food was being taken from the bowl, or any “seeing, seeing, seeing” as it was being lifted to your mouth? As with any mindfulness practice, if you notice that you’ve lost focus or are not paying attention, don’t worry about it.  Noticing is the whole point and it means you’re doing it! Just take note and start again.  <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          
          Eating mindfully can be a very difficult process and it’s important to be kind to yourself.  Just giving one of these practices a try is cause for celebration, for it shows that you have an intention to become more mindful and that intention alone will carry you toward a deeper awareness of yourself.

          In Vipassana meditation, there is a common instruction for when the mind has wandered off into thought, as it so often does.  That instruction is "return again to the breath."  Through this process of returning again and again to the steadiness of our breath from the slippery, wandering thought patterns we are all drawn to, we begin to open up to a greater awareness of the inconstant nature of the thinking mind.  I have begun to build a website at least a half dozen times over the past too many years.  And each beginning has found it's end in an unsatisfactory deleting of everything that was built, and a long period of avoidance and denial of the pain and self-judgement of not having a website. And then repeat.  And repeat.  <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


          But now, my friends, I have once again returned to the starting point and have seen it through to a reasonable completion and I now present to you: a website! And it's first blog post.  So here now is a hub to present my creative work in my own little corner of the internet.  And as I begin again, it will not be from the beginning, but from a grounded space that I may call home.  <br>
