            Gregory Allison creates with a single violin a sound that travels across great landscapes.  He brings the sensibility of a film composer into a live and intimate setting.  His training in South Indian Classical music brings a melodic fluency and emotional fire to his compositions while his Western Classical training is apparent in the wide sonic palette that he creates.  He is a sound shaper.  His violin goes from intimate weeping to orchestral soundscapes, carrying the listener on a journey all the way. <br>

            <br>
            A composer, multi-instrumentalist, and actor who performs in a wide variety of styles and genres, Greg is originally from Madison, WI where he began studying piano at age 5 and violin at 9.  In high school he used his classical violin training as a springboard for learning about improvising, jazz, world music traditions.  He started playing the mandolin and his studies on the instrument landed him a four-year scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston where he completed a degree in Composition. After college he moved to Vermont and was a founding member of the ME/2 Orchestra, a nationally-recognized full orchestra based in Burlington, VT created for people with mental disabilities and those who support them. He also performed in the traditional middle eastern music ensemble Grup Anwar, and travelled to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with the Vermont theater troupe Spielpalast Cabaret. In Portland, OR he opened a private studio teaching violin, viola, mandolin, and piano while performing over 200 shows a year with Three for Silver, Eliza Rickman, as a sideman for various local bands, and as a studio musician. He has received two U.S. State Department grants to tour and teach in Russia. <br>

            In 2018 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a solo performing, recording, and film scoring career.  He formed the acoustic trio RAQIA who will be releasing their second studio album next year. His first solo album is due out in early 2021.
